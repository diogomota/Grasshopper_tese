#Optimization of high voltage trasmission towers using genetic algorithms 

-Files:

"Point Cloud.gh" grasshopper file used to test the code that generates the initial tower geometry.
/Main_App/Fraser -> actual C# program that asks for section definition, tower geometry and initiates the genetic algorithm
